            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">What is an anesthesiologist?</h1>
            <p className="py-4">
              An anesthesiologist is a medical doctor who directs your
              anesthesia care, pain management and critical care before, during
              and after surgeries and invasive procedures.

            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">What is anesthesia?</h1>
            <p className="py-2">
              Anesthesia is a medical treatment that keeps you from feeling pain
              during procedures or surgery. The medications anesthesiologists
              and other healthcare providers use to block pain are called
              anesthetics. Different types of anesthesia work in different ways.
              Some anesthetic medications numb certain parts of your body, while
              other medications numb your brain to induce sleep for more
              invasive surgical procedures, like those within your head, chest
              or abdomen. If youre having a relatively simple procedure that
              covers a very small area of your body, such as a dental filling,
              the provider performing your procedure will often administer a
              local anesthetic, which only works to block pain at a certain
              local area of your body.

              Is an anesthesiologist a doctor?
            </h1>
            <p className="py-2">
              Yes, a physician anesthesiologist is a doctor, just like your
              surgeon and primary care provider. They have a Doctor of Medicine
              (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree, and together
              with their college degree and residency training after medical
              school, have 12 to 14 years of training in total.

              What does an anesthesiologist do?
            </h1>
            <p className="py-2">
              Similar to your primary care doctor, your physician
              anesthesiologist manages all aspects of your medical care (blood
              pressure, diabetes, asthma and heart conditions), while
              administering an anesthetic that makes you or part of your body
              unaware of pain from the procedure being performed.
              Anesthesiologists help to ensure your safety when you’re
              undergoing surgery or an invasive procedure, making sure your body
              parts are well padded and protected from injury while you’re
              unaware of your surroundings. Anesthesiologists have important
              responsibilities before, during and after a surgery or procedure:
              Before surgery: Your anesthesiologist is responsible for assessing
              your health and test results, your fitness for the planned surgery
              and determining the safest anesthesia plan for you. During
              surgery: Your anesthesiologist monitors your vital signs during
              surgery, manages your medical conditions, and administers fluids,
              blood products and medications to support your bodily functions,
              such as the function of your heart, lungs and kidneys. They may
              work alone or with an anesthesia care team that may consist of
              nurse anesthetists or physician anesthesiologists in training.
              After surgery: Your anesthesiologist is responsible for your
              wellbeing after surgery while you’re recovering from the effects
              of anesthesia. They’re typically the healthcare provider who
              decides when you have recovered from the effects of anesthesia and
              are ready to go home or go to another room in the hospital.
              Anesthesiologists also have an important role in taking care of
              people who are having minor surgery or who may not need to be
              unconscious with a general anesthesia, such as people in labor
              ready to deliver a baby. They care for people after major surgery
              in the intensive care unit. They also help people who have serious
              pain from an injury or chronic pain, such as ongoing back pain,
              within a pain management team in the hospital or in an office
              setting.
